## GIFTjs

Lightweight node module for data encryption and decryption using lightweight encryption algorithm GIFT-128.
This is Nodejs adaptation of [GIFT-128 C implementation](https://github.com/giftcipher/gift) for the purpose of its future implementation in IoT.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

GIFT-128-128 is a 40-round SPN cipher, which have a key length of 128-bit.
GIFT is a very simple and clean design that outperforms even SIMON or SKINNY for round-based implementations, making it one of the most
energy efficient ciphers as of today. It reaches a point where almost
the entire implementation area is taken by the storage and the Sboxes,
where any cheaper choice of Sbox would lead to a very weak proposal.
In essence, GIFT is composed of only Sbox and bit-wiring, but its natural
bitslice data flow ensures excellent performances in all scenarios, from
area-optimised hardware implementations to very fast software implementation on high-end platforms.

## Installation

   ```sh
   npm i giftjs
   ```
   
## Usage

Encrypt and decrypt are functions that accept 2 parameters(PLAINTEXT - 128bit hex, KEY - 128bit hex).
Both functions permute PLAINTEXT variable.
```js
import { encrypt , decrypt } from 'giftjs';

encrypt(PLAINTEXT,KEY);
decrypt(PLAINTEXT,KEY);

```
